# send-arduino-alert-to-phone-using-telegram-bot
Without using any extra hardware module like esp8266 etc users can send the arduino alerts to their mobile phone using  telegram bot .

You just have to connect the arduino to your laptop  using usb cable ;))

Before running the script make sure you have imported the library used in the script i.e, serial and requests.

Replace the variables in the code

## Close other windows like arduino ide etc that are using same serial port and then run the script after connecting the arduino setup to laptop using usb cable ;))

thankyou
